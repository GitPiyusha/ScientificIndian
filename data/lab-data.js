Three different types of impellers (forward curved, radial, and backward curved vanes) can be easily fitted on the motor shaft for comparative performance study. Air discharge is accurately measured using an orifice meter with manometer. A flow control valve is provided on the discharge side to vary the head. Input power to the motor is measured with an energy meter.

  description:
    "The apparatus visually demonstrates the formation and properties of free and forced vortices in fluid mechanics. A transparent acrylic cylinder is mounted on a rotatable base plate. For free vortex, water is introduced tangentially into the stationary cylinder, creating a vortex where angular momentum is conserved. For forced vortex, the cylinder is rotated by a small motor at controlled speeds, forming a parabolic water surface profile. A pointer gauge with scale allows measurement of X and Y coordinates to plot the vortex surface profile. Students can calculate velocity distribution, compare free (hyperbolic profile) vs forced (parabolic profile) vortices, and verify theoretical equations like v ∝ 1/r for free vortex and v ∝ r for forced vortex.",

  "description": "This apparatus clearly demonstrates the fundamental principle of generation of involute curve as the envelope of a straight line (rack tooth) rolling without slip on a pitch circle. A transparent acrylic disc representing the gear blank is free to rotate on a fixed centre. A sliding acrylic rack with straight-sided tooth profile is moved linearly while maintaining pure rolling contact with the disc. As the rack moves, a marker pen fixed on the rack tooth traces the exact involute curve on the rotating disc. When one complete rack tooth passes across the disc, a perfect involute tooth profile is generated. Three different disc diameters are provided to show the effect of pitch circle diameter on the same base circle (same involute curve).",

  "description": "The apparatus works on the fundamental principle of pressure = force/area and is considered the most accurate method for calibrating pressure gauges in laboratories. A precision-ground piston-cylinder assembly is filled with oil. Known dead weights are placed on the piston platform, and pressure is generated in the system by gently rotating the handwheel, which lifts the piston-weight assembly. The pressure thus developed is simultaneously applied to the gauge under test (mounted on the block) and to the piston. Equilibrium is indicated when the piston floats freely. By selecting appropriate weights, the gauge can be calibrated at various points across its full range with traceability to primary standards.",
